# Arduino DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor with I2C LCD

This project demonstrates how to build a simple environmental monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and an I2C Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The system reads the ambient temperature and humidity and displays the values on the LCD screen.

## Features

* Measures ambient temperature (°C).
* Measures ambient relative humidity (%).
* Displays real-time data on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
* Compact and easy to build.

## Circuit Diagram

Below is the circuit diagram showing how to connect the components.
